This updated version of the program now instead of having a limit of 10 digits it accepts the decimal equevilant of 31 bit long binary number.(overkill since the test can go only up to 255)
It also fixed a previous issue where the program would tell you use the register $t10 wich doesn't exist.(under normal use it is uncommon)
Better instruction description so people can understand by themselves how to use the program even though it is not meant for wide use.
